Bracket is a music player that plays your music in your web browser without third party plugins, software, or even an active internet connection.  Right
now only mp3's are supported and it is in beta, so there may be hiccups.  Just press refresh or re-install bracket if you think there is a problem.

Bracket features:
completely offline
mp3 support
tag parser
tag based interface
folder import
no adobe flash

Updates:
music search
last.fm integration for normalizing track data
last.fm album artwork downloads
minor bug fixes

Beta Warnings:
Right now Google Chrome has a 1GB file limit for indexeddb.  This means that if you attempt to put more than 1 gigabyte of music into bracket it will stop
importing songs.  The chromium team is working on a fix: https://github.com/chmoder/bracket/issues/1
